# flowroute-numbers-php

**flowroute-numbers-php** is a PHP API Wrapper that provides methods for interacting with **v1** (version 1) of the [Flowroute](https://www.flowroute.com) API. These methods can be used to accomplish the following:

* Search for purchasable phone numbers
* Purchase phone numbers
* View your owned phone numbers and their related details
* Create new inbound routes
* Update the primary and failover route on a phone number

### Documentation 
The full documentation for the v1 Flowroute API is available [here](https://developer.flowroute.com/v1.0/docs).

##Before you begin

The following are required before you can deploy the SDK.

### Have your API credentials

You will need your Flowroute API credentials (Access Key and Secret Key). These can be found on the **Preferences > API Control** page of the [Flowroute](https://manage.flowroute.com/accounts/preferences/api/) portal. If you do not have API credentials, contact <mailto:support@flowroute.com>.

### Know your Flowroute phone number

To create and send a message, you will need your Flowroute phone number, which should be enabled for SMS. If you do not know your phone number, or if you need to verify whether or not it is enabled for SMS, you can find it on the [DIDs](https://manage.flowroute.com/accounts/dids/) page of the Flowroute portal.

###Download Composer

Composer is used to manage the dependencies for the PHP SDK. The Composer installation file, **composer.phar**, can be downloaded from Composer's web site [here](https://getcomposer.org/download). Download, but do not install it; only after first installing the libraries will you install Composer.

## Install the libraries

> **Note:** You must be connected to the Internet in order to install the required libraries.

1. Open a terminal session. 

2. If needed, create a parent directory where you want to install the SDK.
 
3. Change directories to the newly created directory, and from the command line run:

 	`git clone https://github.com/flowroute/flowroute-numbers-php.git`
 	
 	The `git clone` command clones the **flowroute-numbers-php** respository as a sub directory within the parent folder.
 	
4.	Change directories to the newly created **flowroute-numbers-php** directory.

##Install Composer

1.	Move the downloaded **composer.phar** file to the **flowroute-numbers-php** directory.

	>**Note:** **composer.phar** must be in the **flowroute-numbers-php** directory in order to install correctly. Composer requires a **composer.json** file, which is included in the imported SDK to help manage dependencies.

2. 	From a terminal window, run:

		php composer.phar install

 	Composer sets up the required file structure.

3. Next, set up **flowroute-numbers-php** to use your API credentials. 

##Set up your API credentials<a name=credentials></a>

1.	From the **flowroute-numbers-php** directory change directories to **src**. 

2.	Using a code text editor, open **Configuration.php**.

3.	In **Configure.php** replace the AccessKey and SecretKey variables with your Flowroute API credentials. The file should resemble the following:

	```sh
		<?php
		/*
		 * FlowrouteNumbersLib
		 *
		 * This file was automatically generated for flowroute by APIMATIC BETA v2.0 on 02/12/2016
		 */
	
		namespace FlowrouteNumbersLib;
	
		class Configuration {
 			//The base Uri for API calls
   			public static $BASEURI = 'https://api.flowroute.com/v1';
	
			//Tech Prefix
    		//TODO: Replace the $username with an appropriate value
			public static $username = '1111111';

			//API Secret Key
			//TODO: Replace the $password with an appropriate value
			public static $password = 'm8axLA45yds7kmiC88aOQ9d5caADg6vr';
		}
```

4.	Save the file.

	The Controllers point automatically to **Configuration.php**, so there is no need to do anything else with this file.
	
5.	With the libraries set up and your API credentials added, you can now run the methods to perform functions within the SDK. There are two ways of doing this.

	*	[Use demo.php](#usedemo)
	*	[Create a PHP file](#createphp)

## Use demo.php<a name=usedemo></a>

A demo PHP file, **demo.php**, is included with the installed libraries. This file contains a list of the methods and parameters.  You can use this file to run with your API credentials and retrieve information.

To use **demo.php**, open the file with a code text editor, such as *Sublime Text*, and modify parameters if needed or comment out lines. Whether or not you add any parameters or comment out lines, the file can be run as-is by running the following on the command line:

	run demo.php

For information on the parameters within the file, see the applicable Controller information:

*	[`PurchasablePhoneNumbersController`](#purchaseno)

*	[`TelephoneNumbersController`](#telephoneno)

*	[`InboundRoutesController`](#inboundco) 

If you do not want to use the file, the following sections describe creating your own PHP files.

## Create a PHP file to import the Controllers and Models<a name=createphp></a>

The following describes importing the SDK and setting up your API credentials. Importing the SDK allows you to instantiate the [Controllers](#controllers), which contain the methods used to perform tasks with the SDK. In order to do this, create and run a PHP file. 

When creating your own file for running the methods you will need to create one or more files that instantiate the Controllers and the methods. 

The following shows an example of a single PHP file that instantiates all Controllers:
	
		require_once('vendor/autoload.php');
	
		use FlowrouteNumbersLib\Controllers\InboundRoutesController;
		use FlowrouteNumbersLib\Controllers\PurchasablePhoneNumbersController;
		use FlowrouteNumbersLib\Controllers\TelephoneNumbersController;
		use FlowrouteNumbersLib\APIException;
		
		$irc = new InboundRoutesController();
		$pnc = new PurchasablePhoneNumbersController();
		$tnc = new TelephoneNumbersController();
		
		use FlowrouteNumbersLib\Models\BillingMethod;
		use FlowrouteNumbersLib\Models\Route;
		
		
		
 >**Important:** Throughout this SDK, `response` is used in examples. `response` is a variable name that can be changed to a name of your own choosing. It can support an unlimited number of characters. If you choose to rename `response`, make sure that any method that references that variable name is also changed to use the new name. For example, you might have the following:
>
>`$blob = $pnc->listAvailableNPAs();`
>
>`print_r($blob);`
 
 You can create your own PHP file using any of the following methods:
 
 1.	Create a single file that contains all of the Controllers and methods, then commenting out the lines for each method you don't want to run.
 
 2.	Create a unique file for each Controller, adding only those lines relevant to that Controller and related methods, and then commenting out the lines for each method you're not using. You would create three unique Controller files.
 
 3.	Create a unique file for each method. Each file will then contain the lines instantiating the relevant Controller.

TThis SDK describes the third option. However, whichever option you select, the file(s) should be saved in the **flowroute-numbers-php** directory. When you want to run a method, run the following on the command line in the **flowroute-numbers-php** directory:

		run <Controller File Name.php>


## Controllers<a name=controllers></a>

This following sections describe **flowroute-numbers-php** Controllers:

*	[`PurchasablePhoneNumbersController`](#purchaseno)

*	[`TelephoneNumbersController`](#telephoneno)

*	[`InboundRoutesController`](#inboundco) 

###Passing parameters and values in a method

When passing a method, and the method has additional parameters, you are not required to pass the parameter name in the method. For example, a method can pass parameters as follows:

	listAreaAndExchange ($limit=10,$npa=206,$page=3);
	
However, the method can also be run without passing the parameter name:

	listAreaAndExchange (10,206,3);

Examples in this SDK use the latter method of not passing parameter names.

### PurchasablePhoneNumbersController<a name=purchaseno></a>

The PurchasablePhoneNumbers Controller supports all of the methods necessary to search through Flowroute's phone number inventory. Methods must be added to a PHP file and that file run from a command line. For example, you can create a **purchase.php** file contains the following information:

	<?php

	require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

	use FlowrouteNumbersLib\Controllers\PurchasablePhoneNumbersController;
	use FlowrouteNumbersLib\APIException;
	
	$pnc = new PurchasablePhoneNumbersController();

	#List Available NPAs
	$response = $pnc->listAvailableNPAs();
	print_r($response);
	
	#List Area and Exchange
	$response = $pnc->listAreaAndExchange();
	print_r($response);
	
	#Search
	$response = $pnc->search();
	print_r($response);	
	
	?>

Add the following PurchasePhoneNumbersController methods between `$pnc = new PurchasablePhoneNumbersController();` and `?>`. If you do not want to execute a specific method, comment those lines out with `#`

*	[`listAvailableNPAs()`](#listnpa)
* 	[`listAreaAndExchange()`](#listnpanxx)
* 	[`search()`](#searchno)

You can run the file on the command line using the `php <PHP file>` command.

#### `listAvailableNPAs ($limit);`<a name=listnpa></a>

The `listAvailableNPAs` method allows you to retrieve a list of every NPA (area code) available in Flowroute's phone number inventory.
#####Usage

	$response = $pnc->listAvailableNPAs();
	print_r($response);

The method can take the following parameter:

| Parameter | Required |Type |Description                           |
|-----------|----------|-----|--------------------------------|
| `limit`     | False  |integer| Controls the number of items returned. The maximum number of items is 200. If neither a number nor `null` are passed, a default of ten NPAs are returned. |

##### Example usage
	
	$response = $pnc->listAvailableNPAs(3);
	print_r($response);

#####Example response
For the `listAvailableNPAs(3)` request, the first three NPAs are returned:

```sh
(
    [npas] => stdClass Object
        (
            [201] => stdClass Object
                (
                    [nxxs] => /v1/available-tns/npanxxs/?npa=201
                    [tns] => /v1/available-tns/tns/?npa=201
                )

            [203] => stdClass Object
                (
                    [nxxs] => /v1/available-tns/npanxxs/?npa=203
                    [tns] => /v1/available-tns/tns/?npa=203
                )

            [202] => stdClass Object
                (
                    [nxxs] => /v1/available-tns/npanxxs/?npa=202
                    [tns] => /v1/available-tns/tns/?npa=202
                )

        )

    [links] => stdClass Object
        (
            [next] => /v1/available-tns/npas/?limit=3&page=2
        )
```

#### `listAreaAndExchange ($limit,$npa,$page);`<a name=listnpanxx></a>

The `listAreaAndExchange` method allows you to retrieve a list of every NPANXX (area code and exchange) combination available in Flowroute's phone number inventory.

#####Usage

	$response = $pnc->listAreaAndExchange();
	print_r($response);

The method takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Required |Type| Description                                                         |
|-----------|----------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `limit`     | False    | integer| Controls the number of items returned. The maximum number of items is 200. If neither a number nor `null` are passed, a default of ten NPANXX combinations are returned.                 |
| `npa`       | False  | integer| Three-digit area code. Limits results to the specified NPA. If `null` is passed, all NPAs are returned. Partial number search is also supported. For example, passing `20` returns all NPA and NXX results that include `20`.|
| `page`      | False  |integer  | Sets which page of the results is returned.` Next` and `Prev` URLs provided at the bottom of the response provide navigation pointers. If `null` is passed, all pages are returned.   |

##### Example usage

In the following, a request is made to limit the results to `2`, the NPA to `203` and to display page `3`:
		
	$response = $pnc->listAreaAndExchange(2,203,2);
	print_r($response);
	
#####Example response
Based on the example usage above, the following two NPANXX combinations are returned on page 2, organized by NPANXX. 

```sh
(
    [npanxxs] => stdClass Object
        (
            [203583] => stdClass Object
                (
                    [tns] => /v1/available-tns/tns/?npa=203&nxx=583
                )
            [203567] => stdClass Object
                (
                    [tns] => /v1/available-tns/tns/?npa=203&nxx=567
                )
        )
    [links] => stdClass Object
        (
            [prev] => /v1/available-tns/npanxxs/?npa=203&limit=2&page=2
            [next] => /v1/available-tns/npanxxs/?npa=203&limit=2&page=4
        )
)
```
#### `search ($limit,$npa,$nxx,$page,$ratecenter,$state,$tn);`<a name=searchno></a>

The search method is the most robust option for searching through Flowroute's purchasable phone number inventory. It allows you to search by NPA, NXX, Ratecenter, State, and TN.

#####Usage

	$response = $pnc->search();
	print_r($response);

The method supports the following parameters:

| Parameter  | Required|   Type|          Description                                         |
|------------|----------|------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `limit`     | False    | integer| Controls the number of items returned. The maximum number of items is 200. If neither a number nor `null` are passed, a default of ten NPANXX combinations are returned.                      |
| `npa`       | False, unless `nxx` is passed, then `True`.  | integer| Three-digit area code. Limits results to the specified NPA. If `null` is passed, all NPAs are returned. Partial number search is also supported. For example, passing `20` returns all NPA and NXX results that include `20`.|
| `nxx`       |False  | integer |Three-digit exchange. Limits the results for the specified NXX. If no `nxx` is passed, `null` is used and all results are returned. Partial search is also supported. For example, passing `'45'` for the `nxx` returns exchanges that include `45`. Note that if you pass an `nxx` you must also pass an `npa`. |
| `page`      | False   | integer |Sets which page of the results is returned.` Next` and `Prev` URLs provided at the bottom of the response provide navigation pointers. If `null` is passed, all pages are returned.   |            |
| `ratecenter` | False |string             | Limits the results to the specified ratecenter.  There is no limit on the number of characters that can be passed, and this field is case-insensitive. |                      |
| `state`      | False, unless `ratecenter` is passed, then `True`.|string | Limits results to the specified state or Canadian province. Must be formatted using the two-letter state or province/territory abbreviation. This field is case-insensitive.                           |
| `tn`         | False  |string             | Limits results to the specified telephone number. The phone number must be passed as an 11-digit number formatted as *`1NPAXXXXXX`*.  |

##### Example Usage

In the following example, a search request sets the `limit` to `3`, `206` for the `npa`, `641` for the `nxx`, `2` for the `page`, `seattle` for the `ratecenter`, `wa` for the `state`, and `null` for the `tn`.

	$response = $pnc->search(3,206,641,2,seattle,wa,null);
	print_r($response);
	
#####Response
Based on the passed parameters passed in `search()`, the response returns three results:

```sh

### TelephoneNumbersController<a name=telephoneno></a>

The TelephoneNumbersController supports all of the methods necessary to purchase and manage a Flowroute number. Methods must be added to a PHP file and that file run from a command line. For example, you can create a **telephone.php** file contains the following information:

	<?php

	require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

	use FlowrouteNumbersLib\Controllers\TelephoneNumbersController;
	use FlowrouteNumbersLib\APIException;
	
	$tnc = new TelephoneNumbersController();
	
	use FlowrouteNumbersLib\Models\BillingMethod;
	
	#Purchase a Telephone Number
	$billing = new BillingMethod('');
	$number = 'phone number';
	$response = $tnc->purchase($billing, $number);
	print_r($response);
	
	#List Account Telephone Numbers
	$response = $tnc->listAccountTelephoneNumbers();
	print_r($response);
	
	#Telephone Number Details
	$number = 'telephoneNumber';
	$response = $tnc->telephoneNumberDetails($number);
	print_r($response);
	
	#Update Telephone Number Routes
	$rtes = '{"routes": [{"name": "primary route name"}, {"name": "failover route name"}]}'; 
	$response = $tnc->update('number',$rtes);
	print_r($response);
	
	?>

Add any of the following TelephoneNumbersController methods between `$use FlowrouteNumbersLib\Models\BillingMethod;` and `?>`.  If you do not want to execute a specific method, comment those lines out with `#`

The TelephoneNumbersController supports the following methods:

*	[`purchase`](#purchaseno)
*	[`listAccountTelephoneNumbers`](#listnumbers)
*	[`telephoneNumberDetails`](#phonedetails)
*	[`update`](#updateroute)

#### `purchase ($billing, $number);`<a name=purchaseno></a>

The purchase method is used to purchase a telephone number from Flowroute's inventory.

#####Usage

	$billing = new BillingMethod('');
	$number = 'phone number';
	$response = $tnc->purchase($billing, $number);
	print_r($response);

Create three variables:

|Variable name    |Required  |Type      |Description|
|-----------------|----------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------| 
|`$billing `      | True     | string   |This variable assigns the billing method. An unlimited number of characters can be used. For this example, `$billing` is the name of the variable. |
|`$number`        | True     | string   | This variable identifies the phone number to purchase. An unlimited number of characters can be used. For this example, `$number` is the name of the variable.|
|`$response`      | True     | string   | This variable identifies the response to purchase. An unlimited number of characters can be used. For this example, `$response` is the name of the variable.|

The variables then take the following parameters

| Parameter       | Required | Type|Description                                                 |                                                          
|-----------------|----------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `BillingMethod`   | True     |string  | Sets the billing method applied to the purchased number. This must be one of the following: <ul><li>`METERED` — unlimited concurrent calls, each billed per-minute used.</li> <li> `VPRI` — limits the number of concurrent calls to the number of VPRI channels you have, but with unlimited usage on each channel. </li></ul>|       
| `phone number` | True    | string | The telephone number to purchase, using an E.164 *`1NPANXXXXXX`* format.                |
	
##### Example Usage

For the following example, a new number is purchased using `VPRI` for the billing method:

	$billing = new BillingMethod('VPRI');
	$number = '12066417848';
	$response = $tnc->purchase($billing, $number);
	print_r($response);

#####Example response

If the purchase is successful, a **201 Created** and empty message string are returned indicating the date on which the purchase occurred:

		(
   		 [code] => 201
       		 [raw_body] =>
   		 [body] =>
   		 [headers] => Array
     	   (
     	       [0] => HTTP/1.1 201 Created
     	       [Content-Type] => application/json
    	        [Date] => Thu, 26 May 2016 18:32:36 GMT
    	        [Server] => nginx
   	         [Content-Length] => 0
    	        [Connection] => keep-alive
  	    	  )


####`listAccountTelephoneNumbers ($limit,$page,$pattern);`<a name=listnumbers></a>

The `listAccountTelephoneNumbers` method is used to retrieve a list of all of the phone numbers on your Flowroute account.

#####Usage

	$response = $tnc->listAccountTelephoneNumbers();
	print_r($response);

The method takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Required |     Type | Description                                    |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `limit`     | False    | integer| Controls the number of items returned. The maximum number of phone numbers is 200. If neither a number nor `null` are passed, a default of ten numbers are returned.                      
| `page`      | False  |integer  | Sets which page of the results is returned.` Next` and `Prev` URLs provided at the bottom of the response provide navigation pointers. If `null` is passed, all pages are returned.   |
| pattern   | False | string  | The phone number on which to search. Partial number search is supported; for example, if `206` is passed the response returns all phone numbers which include `206`. If neither a number nor `null` are passed, all numbers associated with the account are returned.  |

##### Example Usage
For this example, the `limit` is `1`, the `page` is `null`, and the `pattern` includes `206`.
	
	$response = $tnc->listAccountTelephoneNumbers(1,null,206);
	print_r($response);

#####Example response

Based on the passed parameters, the number purchased using the [purchase](#purhcaseno) method above is returned as the response:

If no `name` was given to the route, `sip-reg` is the assigned default name.</ul></li> **Note:** Routes are created using the [createNewRoute](#createroute) method and existing routes can be viewed using the [mlist](#listroutes) method.|

#### `telephoneNumberDetails($number);`<a name=phonedetails></a>

The telephoneNumberDetails method is used to retrieve the billing method, primary route, and failover route for the specified telephone number. 

#####Usage

		$number = 'telephoneNumber';
		$response = $tnc->telephoneNumberDetails($number);
		print_r($response);

>**Note:** `$number` and `$response` can be any name of your choosing, and of any length, but the name you choose must be used consistently in the PHP file.

The method takes the following parameter:

| Parameter       | Required | Type   |Description                                    |
|-----------------|----------|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| `telephoneNumber` | True     | string |    The telephone number on which to query. You must use an 11-digit, E.164 number, formatted as *`1NPANXXXXXX`*. Neither partial number search nor multiple number search are supported. |

##### Example Usage

For the following example, the number purchased using the [purchase](#purchaseno) method is passed in the request:

	$number = '12066417848';
	$response = $tnc->telephoneNumberDetails($number);
	print_r($response);

#####Example response
	(
    [billing_method] => VPRI
    [routes] => Array
        (
            [0] => stdClass Object
                (
                    [type] => SIP-REG

                    [type] => SIP-REG
                    [name] => sip-reg
                )
        )
	)

#####Response field descriptions	
 
The following information is returned in the response:

Parameter | Description                                             |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|                       
|`billing_method`| The billing method assigned to the phone number when the number was purchased. This will be either `METERED` or `VPRI`.|
|`routes` |Displays the primary `[0]` and failover `[1]` routes for the phone number:<br> <ul><li>`type` — Indicates the type of route: `HOST`, `PSTN`, or `URI`. If no route is assigned, `SIP-REG` is the default name assigned to the route.</li> <li>`name` — Name of the route. If no `name` was given to the route, `sip-reg` is the default name.</ul></li>**Note:** Routes are created using the [createNewRoute](#createroute) method and can be assigned using the `update` method.|

#### `update ($number, $rtes);`<a name=updateroute></a>

The `update` method is used to update both the primary and failover route for a phone number. Both the primary and failover route must be specified inside of an array. See Example Usage below. The first route name specified is assigned as the primary route and the second route name specified will be assigned as the failover route. The list of available route names can be retrieved by using the list method in the InboundRoutesController.

>**Note:** In order to apply an existing route to a number, the route must first be created using the [createNewRoute](#createRoute) method. To view a list of your existing routes, use the [`mlist`](#listroutes) method.

#####Usage

	$rtes = '{"routes": [{"name": "primary route name"}, {"name": "failover route name"}]}'; 
	$response = $tnc->update('number',$rtes);
	print_r($response);

>**Important:** `$rtes` and `$response` are variables that can be assigned any name of you choose, and of any length; however, you must use those names consistently within the PHP file.

The method takes the following parameters:

| Parameter       | Required | Type |Description |                                                     
|-----------------|----------|-------|----------------------------------------------------------|
|`name='route name'`|True| string| Name of an existing route. The first `name` in the array will be assigned the primary route; the second `name` in the array will be assigned the secondary, or failover, route. 
| `number` | True     | string |    The telephone number for which to update the route. You must use an 11-digit, E.164 number, formatted as *`1NPANXXXXXX`*.| 

##### Example Usage
	
	$rtes = '{"routes": [{"name": "HOSTroute1"}, {"name": "PSTNroute1"}]}'; 
	$response = $tnc->update('12064205780',$rtes);
	print_r($response);
	
#####Example response

No confirmation message is returned for a successful update. To view the route changes on the phone number, run the 
[`listAccountTelephoneNumbers()`](#inboundco) or [`telephoneNumberDetails()`](#phonedetails) methods.

#####Error response 
| Error code | Message  | Description                                           |
|------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|No error code.  |HTTP Response Not OK|This can be caused when a route does not exist, a route name has been misspelled, or an incorrect phone number was passed in the PHP file.|

###InboundRoutesController<a name=inboundco></a>

The InboundRoutesController supports the methods required to view all of your existing inbound routes and to create new inbound routes. Methods must be added to a PHP file and that file run from a command line. For example, you can create a **routes.php** file that must contain the following information:

	<?php

	require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

	use FlowrouteNumbersLib\Controllers\InboundRoutesController;
	use FlowrouteNumbersLib\APIException;

	$irc = new InboundRoutesController();
	
	use FlowrouteNumbersLib\Models\Route;
	
	#List Routes
	$response = $inbound->mlist();
	print_r($response);
	
	#Create a New Route
	$response = $irc->createNewRoute('routeName','type','value');
	print_r($response);

	?>

Add the following InboundRoutesController methods between `use FlowrouteNumbersLib\Models\Route;` and `?>`. If you do not want to execute a specific method, comment those lines out with `#`.

The Controller supports the following methods:

*	[`mlist`](#listroutes)
* 	[`createNewRoute`](#createroute)

#### `mlist ($limit,$page);`<a name=listroutes></a>

The list method is used to return all of the existing inbound routes from your Flowroute account.

#####Usage

	$response = $inbound->mlist();
	print_r($response);

>**Important:**  `$inbound` and `$response` are variables that can be assigned any name of you choose, and of any length; however, you must use the names consistently within the PHP file.

The method takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Type   |Description                                    |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| `limit`     | False    | integer| Controls the number of routes returned. The maximum number is 200. If neither a number nor `null` are passed, a default of ten routes are returned.  |                    
| `page`      | False  |integer  | Sets which page of the results is returned.` Next` and `Prev` URLs provided at the bottom of the response provide navigation pointers. If `null` is passed, all pages are returned.   |

##### Example Usage

For this example, a `limit` of `4` routes  and the `page` to return set to `null` are passed.

	$inbound = new InboundRoutesController();
	$response = $inbound->mlist(4,null);
	print_r($response);
	
#####Example response

Based on the parameters passed in the request, the following is returned:

	(
    [routes] => stdClass Object
        (
            [HOSTroute1] => stdClass Object
                (
                    [type] => HOST
                    [value] => 24.239.23.40:5060
                )
            [PSTNroute1] => stdClass Object
                (
                    [type] => PSTN
                    [value] => 178
                )
            [URIroute1] => stdClass Object
                (
                    [type] => URI
                    [value] => sip:16476998778@215.122.69.152:5060
                )
            [sip-reg] => stdClass Object
                (
                    [type] => SIP-REG
                    [value] =>
                )
        )
	)

These routes can be applied to any of your purchased phone numbers using the [`update`](#updateroute) method.

#####Response field descriptions

The following information is returned in the response:

| Parameter |  Description                                                     |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `[routeName]` |  The name of the route assigned using the `createNewRoute` method. It is composed of:<ul> <li>`type`  The type of route created using the `createNewRoute` method. Will be `HOST`, `PSTN`, or `URI`. If no route type was assigned, `SIP-REG` is used as the default. <li>`value` Value of the route, assigned to the route `type` using the `createNewRoute` method.</ul</li>|

#### `createNewRoute ($routeName,$type,$value;)`<a name=createroute></a>
 
The `createNewRoute` method is used to create a new inbound route. A new inbound route can then be applied to a phone number using the [`update`](#updateroute) method.

#####Usage

	$response = $irc->createNewRoute('routeName','type','value');
	print_r($response);

The method takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Type| Description                                                                        |
|-----------|----------|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `routeName` | True    |  string| The name of the new route. An unlimited number of alphanumeric characters is supported. There are no unrestricted characters.  |
| `type`      | True   |  string |The type of route you would like to create. Valid options are `HOST`, `PSTN`, and `URI`. |
| `value`     | True    |string |  Value of the route, dependent on the `type`: <ul><li>If `HOST`, the value must be an IP address or URL with an optional port number—for example, an IP address could be `24.239.23.40:5060` or a URL could be `myphone.com`. If no port is specified, the server will attempt to use DNS SRV records. <li>If `PSTN`, the value must be formatted as a valid E.164, 11-digit formatted North American phone number—for example,`12066417848`. You cannot use the same number as the number for which the route is created. <li>If `URI`, the value must be formatted as  `protocol:user@domain[:port][;transport=<tcp/udp>`—for example, `sip:alice@seattle.com`,  `sip:12066417848@215.122.69.152:5060;transport=tcp`, or `sips:securecall@securedserver.com`.You cannot use the same number as the number for which the route is created. </li></ul>              |

##### Example Usage

You can pass as many `createNewRoute` methods in a single operation. The following example creates new `PSTN`, `HOST`, and `URI` routes:

	$response = $irc->createNewRoute('PSTNroute2','PSTN','12066417848');
	print_r($response);
	$response = $irc->createNewRoute('HOSTroute2','HOST','4.239.23.40:5060');
	print_r($response);
	$response = $irc->createNewRoute('URIroute2','URI','sip:12066417848@215.122.69.152:5060');
	print_r($response);
	
#####Example response

No response is returned for each successfully created route; no other code or message is returned. An error encountered for a specific `irc.create_new_route()` line will not prevent the other routes from being created.

#####Error response
The following error can be returned:

| Error code | Message  | Description                                           |
|------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|No error code|HTTP Response Not OK|Typically this occurs when a `value` is malformed. |
